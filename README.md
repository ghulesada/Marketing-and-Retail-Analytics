# Problem
## Company
OList is one such e- commerce company that has faced some losses recently

## Context
They want to manage their inventory very well so as to reduce any unnecessary costs that they might be bearing.

## Problem Statement
Need to identify top revenue-generating products and use Market Basket Analysis to identify individual product categories and combinations that can help with sales growth.

# Project pipeline
**Data exploration and cleaning:** Identify missing and duplicate values in each column and treat them accordingly. Also, treat any and all data quality issues associated with the dataset.

**Data visualisation:** Create appropriate visualisations to identify the most ordered products by quantity and revenue.

**Market basket analysis:** Identify combinations of product categories that are ordered frequently and visualise them as required. This can be done by creating a simple matrix with product categories in the rows and columns and then checking which of the pairs show associations.

**Dashboarding and final PPT:** Create a neat dashboard containing the important visualisations and supplement it with an executive summary containing valuable insights and recommended steps of action.
